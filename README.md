                                                       **Key Features:**

Code Editor: The Codepen Clone offers a powerful code editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a seamless writing experience and enables developers to quickly prototype and iterate on their code.

Live Preview: The Clone includes a live preview panel that instantly renders the code as it is being typed, allowing developers to visualize the output and make real-time adjustments. This feature helps in testing and debugging code efficiently.

Multiple Panels: Similar to Codepen, the Clone supports multiple panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developers can conveniently write and manage code across different tabs, making it easy to organize and modularize their projects.
